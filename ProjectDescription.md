Agentic Investment System
üß† High-Level Agent System Flow
Agents involved:

Twitter Agent: Gathers trending stock tickers using Grok/XAI API.

Finance Data Agent: Gathers financial and sentiment data for those tickers.

Financial Decision Agent: Filters and picks top stocks to invest in.

Advisor Agent: Uses a dynamic, customizable prompt based on user preferences to select which of the candidate stocks best match user goals.

Trade Execution Agent: Executes the selected trades using Alpaca API.

(Optional) Email/Notification Agent: Sends updates or summaries to the user.

üñ•Ô∏è Frontend Flow (User Experience)
User Onboarding

User specifies:

Investment schedule (e.g., daily, weekly)

Custom investment strategy prompt (or picks from templates)

Risk tolerance / sectors (optional for now)

Dashboard UI

Displays:

Editable investment strategy prompt

Portfolio value over time (basic line graph)

Metadata pulled from local JSON

Prompts and preferences are dynamically tied to the Advisor Agent

‚öôÔ∏è Backend Flow (Agent Pipeline)
üîÅ Orchestration
Agents will be invoked via sequential function calls (not queue-based).

HyperMode may be used for convenience, but is not necessary.

Agent communication will be handled via shared text files (one per agent), acting as lightweight state memory.

1. Twitter Agent
Uses Grok/XAI to gather trending stocks.


Raw tweet data will be saved in a text file (no deduplication or spam filtering).

Optionally refined with LLM post-processing or better prompting.

2. Finance Data Agent
Waits for tickers from the Twitter Agent (sync or async, to be determined).
Finance Data Agent: Gathers financial and sentiment data using Finnhub API.

Waits for tickers from the Twitter Agent (sync or async, TBD).

Gathers:

Fundamentals

Earnings

Sentiment

News

Uses Finnhub API for all financial data.

Stores output in a text file (e.g., finance_output.txt) for downstream use.

Outputs stored in its own file (e.g., finance_output.txt).

3. Financial Decision Agent
Ingests Twitter + Finance outputs.

Chooses best investment candidates using heuristic or LLM-based ranking.

Also writes to its own file.

4. Advisor Agent
Reads financial decision file.

Prompt is dynamically generated based on user input from onboarding and dashboard.

Picks final stocks to be sent to Trade Execution Agent.

5. Trade Execution Agent
Uses Alpaca API to execute trades.

Assumes sufficient API quota ‚Äî no failover logic built in.

No guardrails: fully agentic and autonomous execution.

üìä Logging & Persistence
Everything is saved in a local JSON file or folder structure.

Includes:

Timestamps of trades

Agent decisions

Raw Twitter/financial inputs

Advisor agent prompts and outputs

No state persistence beyond basic file I/O. No need for databases or versioning.

Used for:

Debugging

Dashboard graph of portfolio value over time

üß™ Validation & Monitoring
None for MVP.

Performance is only tracked through a graph showing portfolio value (no benchmarks or analytics).
